My research sits at the intersection of convex and combinatorial optimization, with applications to robotics, optimal control, and motion planning.
Specifically, I study optimal decision making in circumstances where discrete and continuous choices have to be taken simultaneously and cohesively.
I work on these problems on a mathematical and numerical level: I develop versatile modeling frameworks, I devise efficient transcriptions as numerical optimizations, and I design fast optimization algorithms (either exact or approximate).

The main outcome of my PhD has been the [shortest-path problem in graphs of convex sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11565).
This novel optimization framework generalizes a variety of important problems in robot navigation, in control of hybrid systems, and in many other areas.
This simple but highly expressive class of problems can be tackled very effectively through a careful blend of network-flow and convex optimization.
Its application to robotics has already enabled us to [solve complex motion-planning problems with unprecedented efficiency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04422.pdf).

[Our laboratory](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) is mainly focused on robotics.
We use of cutting-edge numerical optimization to solve manipulation and locomotion problems.
Never before has robotics posed such challenging and stimulating issues: our ambitious goal is to solve them using rigorous mathematics.
