My research sits at the intersection of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory), [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization), and [convex optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization).
Specifically, I study how optimal control problems for [hybrid dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_system) can be efficiently formulated and solved, exactly or [approximately](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Marcucci17.pdf).
Even though the control community has produced a massive body of work on this topic in the last 20 years, we are only starting to see the full potential of many classical concepts and techniques from [combinatorics](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Marcucci21.pdf) and [integer programming](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Marcucci18.pdf).
Also the [peculiar temporal structure of the problems at hand](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Marcucci19.pdf) plays an extremely important role, yet to be fully explored.
Ultimately, I aim at filling these gaps.

In [our laboratory](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/), we use numerical optimization to solve robot manipulation and locomotion problems.
Never before has robotics posed such challenging and stimulating issues: our ambitious goal is to solve them using rigorous mathematics.
