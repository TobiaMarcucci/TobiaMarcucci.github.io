My research sits at the intersection of convex and combinatorial optimization, with applications to robotics, motion planning, and optimal control.
Specifically, I study optimal decision making in circumstances where discrete and continuous choices have to be made simultaneously.
I work on these problems on a mathematical and numerical level: I develop modeling frameworks, transcriptions as numerical optimizations, and solution algorithms.

The main outcome of my PhD has been the formulation of the [Shortest-Path Problem in Graphs of Convex Sets (SPP in GCS)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11565) and the design of efficient algorithms for its solution.
The SPP in GCS lends itself to a simple statement and generalizes a variety of important problems in multiple areas, including robot navigation and control of hybrid systems.
For its solution we have blended techniques from network-flow and convex optimization to design tight convex relaxations and strong mixed-integer formulations.
Applied to robotics, these algorithms have enabled the [solution of complex motion-planning problems with surprising efficiency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04422.pdf).

[Our laboratory](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) is mainly focused on robotics.
We use cutting-edge numerical optimization to solve manipulation and locomotion problems.
Never before has robotics posed such challenging and stimulating issues: our ambitious goal is to solve them using rigorous mathematics.
