What I do.

<!-- I'm interested in data-driven modeling and control of dynamical systems.
At the moment, I'm particularly interested in exploring the connections between adaptive control, 
[dual control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_control_theory),
and reinforcement learning, i.e., carrying out learning and control simultaneously.

My doctoral research focused on the learning problem (a.k.a. system identification), with an emphasis on convex optimization methods that could guarantee stability of the learned models.

Prior to this I worked on a few robotics applications, including motion planning for dynamic walking bipedal robots, and guidance, navigation and control of autonomous paramotors (motorized parafoils). -->
