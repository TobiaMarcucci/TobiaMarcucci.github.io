# Description

Motion planning and kinematics topics with an emphasis on geometric reasoning, programming and matrix computations.
- Motion planning: sensor-based planning, configuration spaces, decomposition and sampling methods, and advanced
planning algorithms.
- Kinematics: reference frames, rotations and displacements,
kinematic motion models.

# Learning outcomes

Ability to:
- formulate and solve planning and kinematics problems in robotics
- apply knowledge of geometry, graph algorithms and linear algebra to robotic systems
- use the Python programming language to solve engineering problems

# Prerequisites

- Linear algebra: ECE 130C or ME 17 (ECE 130C may be taken concurrently and is offered Spring 2025, course 12402)
- Coding: ECE 3 (Python) or ENGR 3 (MATLAB)
Students that have not taken these specific classes can reach out to the instructor if they are interested in enrolling in the class.

# Lecture time and place

- Monday and Wednesday from 2:00pm to 3:15pm (starting March 31)
- Room 387-1011

# Textbook
