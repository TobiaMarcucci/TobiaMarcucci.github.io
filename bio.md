I graduated cum laude in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pisa in 2015.
From 2015 to 2017 I was Ph.D. student at the Research Center “E. Piaggio”, University of Pisa, and the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT).
Since 2017 I am at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), MIT, to continue my Ph.D. studies.
My main research interests are control theory, numerical optimization, and robotics.
