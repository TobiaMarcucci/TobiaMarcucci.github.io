I graduated cum laude in mechanical engineering from the University of Pisa in 2015.
From 2015 to 2017 I was a PhD student in robotics at the Research Center “E. Piaggio,” University of Pisa, and the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT).
Since 2017 I am at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to continue my PhD studies; my major is in computer science and my minor in mathematics.
My main research interests are control theory, numerical optimization, and robotics.
