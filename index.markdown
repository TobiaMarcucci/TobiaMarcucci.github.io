I am a PhD student at the [Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu) at MIT, working under the supervision of [Russ Tedrake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) and [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/).
Since November 2022 I am visiting [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/)'s group at Stanford University.

On April 22nd I defended my PhD thesis, titled "Graphs of convex sets with applications to optimal control and motion planning." You can find the recording [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mfF1A1s-H87eznmV&v=rSbpfAVF_7c&feature=youtu.be).
