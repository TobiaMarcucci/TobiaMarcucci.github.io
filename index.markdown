# About me

I am a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Robotics and an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu). I received my PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) and [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/). During the PhD, I also spent one year at Stanford University as a visiting researcher in [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/)'s group.

My research is centered on Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), a new framework for decision making that blends combinatorial and convex optimization. If you want to know more about GCS, you can [watch my thesis defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mfF1A1s-H87eznmV&v=rSbpfAVF_7c&feature=youtu.be) or [read my thesis](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Marcucci24a.pdf).

# Recruiting two PhD students

Next spring I will be joining the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu), and I am  looking for two highly motivated PhD students. If you are interested in developing cutting-edge optimization algorithms and applying them in robotics please do not hesitate to send me an email. The deadline for the application is December 15, 2024. Additional info on the application process can be found [here](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/grad/apply).
