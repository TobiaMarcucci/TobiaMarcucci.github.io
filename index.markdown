I am a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Robotics. I received my PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), under the supervision of [Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) and [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/). During the PhD, I also spent one year at Stanford University as a visiting researcher in [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/)'s group.

My research is centered on Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), a new framework for decision making that blends combinatorial and convex optimization. If you want to know more about GCS, you can [watch my thesis defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mfF1A1s-H87eznmV&v=rSbpfAVF_7c&feature=youtu.be) or [read my thesis](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Marcucci24a.pdf).
