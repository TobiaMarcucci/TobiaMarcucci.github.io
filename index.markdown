# About me

I am a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Robotics and an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu). I received my PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) and [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/). During the PhD, I also spent one year at Stanford University as a visiting researcher in [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/)'s group.

My research is centered on Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), a new framework for decision making that blends combinatorial and convex optimization. If you want to know more about GCS, you can [watch my thesis defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mfF1A1s-H87eznmV&v=rSbpfAVF_7c&feature=youtu.be) or [read my thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156598).

# Recruiting two PhD students

I am seeking two highly motivated PhD students to join my newly established research group in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The research will focus on developing novel optimization algorithms for robot motion planning and control. For an example of this research direction, you can view [my PhD thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156598). Candidates with a background in optimization and/or robotics are strongly encouraged to apply. The admission process is handled by the ECE department, and the deadline for applications is December 15, 2024. Additional information can be found [here](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/grad/apply). If you are interested in applying or would like more information about these positions, feel free to send me an email.
