I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu).
My research is centered on Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), a new framework for decision making that blends combinatorial and convex optimization.
If you want to know more about GCS, you can [watch my thesis defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=mfF1A1s-H87eznmV&v=rSbpfAVF_7c&feature=youtu.be) or [read my thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156598).

<h3 style="color: maroon;">Recruiting PhD students</h3>

I am seeking highly motivated PhD students to join my newly established research group at UCSB. The research will focus on developing novel optimization algorithms for robot motion planning and control. For an example of this research direction, you can view [my PhD thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156598). The admission process is handled by the department (see [this page](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/grad/apply) for additional instructions).


<!-- Candidates with a background in optimization and/or robotics are strongly encouraged to apply. The admission process is handled by the ECE department, and the deadline for applications is December 15, 2024. Additional information can be found [here](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/grad/apply). If you are interested in applying or would like more information about these positions, feel free to send me an email. -->
